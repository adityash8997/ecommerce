    question: "Is this legal? Are you officially affiliated with KIIT?",
    answer: "We're an independent student startup serving the KIIT community. While not officially affiliated with the university, we operate within all legal guidelines and focus on helping students with legitimate campus needs. We're students, for students! 👨‍🎓"
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost to use the app?",
    answer: "Many services are completely free (like our AI assistant, fest updates, campus map). Paid services have transparent pricing - printouts start at ₹2/page, assignments at ₹5/page, mentorship at ₹99/session. No hidden fees, ever! 💰"
  },
  {
    question: "Who are you? Can I trust you with my assignments?",
    answer: "We're current KIIT students who faced the same problems you do! Our team includes seniors from various branches who understand academic integrity. For assignments, we provide handwriting services, not academic dishonesty. You still need to understand the content! 📚"
  },
  {
    question: "How fast is the delivery for printouts and assignments?",
    answer: "Printouts: Usually within 2-3 hours during campus hours. Assignments: 24-48 hours depending on length and complexity. Urgent orders available for extra charges. We're faster than your friend who 'will definitely help' but never does! ⚡"
  },
  {
    question: "What if something goes wrong with my order?",
    answer: "We've got you covered! Every order comes with our student-friendly guarantee. Issues with quality? We'll fix it free. Late delivery? You get service credits. Not satisfied? We'll work it out together or provide a refund. Our support team is always here to help make things right! 🛡️"
  },
  {
    question: "Can my parents track my usage or payments?",
    answer: "We respect your privacy completely. Parents can't see your order history or usage patterns. Payments are discreet (shows as 'Campus Services'). Your hostel transfer and assignment needs stay between us! 🤐"
  },
  {
    question: "Do you work during exams and holidays?",
    answer: "Yes! We know that's when you need us most. Limited services during major holidays, but our AI assistant and emergency services (like printouts) are always available. Because deadlines don't take breaks! 📅"
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know which seniors are good for mentorship?",
    answer: "All our mentors are verified with academic records and student reviews. You can see their CGPA, branch, placement status, and previous mentee feedback. Plus, first 15 minutes are free to check compatibility! ⭐"
